=== Service Group - CPPC (SERVICEGROUP_ID: 0x0006)
This service group defines the services to control application processor
performance by managing a set of registers per application processor
that are used for performance management and control. The ACPI CPPC
(Collaborative Processor Performance Control) is an abstract and flexible
mechanism that allows application processor to collaborate with the platform
microcontroller to control the performance.

The CPPC extension defined in the RISC-V SBI specification cite:[SBI] defines
the register IDs for the standard CPPC registers, along with additional
registers also required by the application processor.

The ACPI CPPC specification cite:[ACPI] provides the details of the CPPC registers
and also provides details on the performance control mechanism through CPPC.

This service group works with the abstract performance scale defined by the ACPI
CPPC and is managed by the platform which is responsible for the conversion
between the abstract performance level and the internal performance operating
point.

The platform may have multiple application processors that share the actual
performance controls like clock, voltage regulator and others depending on the
platform. In such cases a performance level change for one application processor
will affect the entire the group sharing the controls. Its the responsibility of
the power and performance management software running on the application processor
and the platform to coordinate and manage the group level performance changes.

The following table lists the services in the CPPC service group:

==== CPPC Fast-channel
The CPPC service group defines the fast-channels to be used by the application
processor to request performance changes and to obtain performance change feedback
for an application processor from the platform microcontroller.

A fast-channel shared memory layout is specific to the CPPC service
group. The data written in a fast-channel do not follow the conventional RPMI
message format. The simple data format supported by the fast-channel allows
faster processing of the performance change requests made through a fast-channel
and faster read of the performance feedback values supported over the
fast-channel.

The CPPC service group defines two types of fast-channel for each application
processor. If fast-channels are supported then each application processor must
be assigned both types fast-channel.

===== Performance Request Fast-channel
In this fast-channel the application processor will either write
the desired performance level in case of normal mode or the minimum
and maximum performance level in case of Autonomous (CPPC2) mode in the
fast-channel. Otherwise the application processor can call the service
`CPPC_WRITE_REG` for the `DesiredPerformanceRegister` or
`MinimumPerformanceRegister` and `MaximumPerformanceRegister`.

The supported values in this fast-channel which depends on the CPPC mode, either
normal or autonomous mode is discoverable through `CPPC_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_REGION`
service.

The size of this fast-channel type is `8 bytes`.

===== Performance Feedback Fast-channel
In this fast-channel the application processor will read the
supported value for estimating the delivered performance as performance feedback
for an application processor. The application processor current frequency (Hz)
is used for performance feedback in this fast-channel. The platform
microcontroller must write the frequency of an application processor in the
fast-channel whenever it changes.

The size of this fast-channel type is `8 bytes`.

| 0x0
| Current frequency low 32-bit (Hz).

| 0x4
| Current frequency high 32-bit (Hz).
|===

===== CPPC Fast-channel Shared Memory Region
The size of the shared memory region containing all the fast-channels for all the
managed application processors must be a `power-of-2`. The `base-address` and `size`
(bytes) of this shared memory region can be discovered using the
service `CPPC_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_REGION`. The `base-address` of the shared memory
region must be aligned to `8 bytes` which is maximum size of a fast-channel in
both the types.

The offsets of fast-channels of both types for an application processor are
aligned to `8 bytes`. The offset of both fast-channel types in the shared memory
region can be discovered through service `CPPC_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_OFFSET`. The
offsets discovered can be added to the `base-address` of the shared memory
region to form the address of Performance Request fast-channel and Performance
Feedback fast-channel for an application processor.

===== Performance Request Fast-channel Doorbell
A doorbell can also be supported for this fast-channel type which is shared
between all the application processors. The doorbell, if supported must be a 
memory mapped register with write access.
The doorbell details and attributes such as doorbell register address, doorbell
write value can be discovered by the application processor through the
`CPPC_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_REGION` service.

The doorbell register address is the physical address of the register.
The doorbell write value is the value which must be written in the doorbell register
to trigger the doorbell interrupt.

The width of the doorbell write value must be equal to the doorbell register width.

NOTE: The write value may also contains other set bits which must persist on every
write to the doorbell register.

[#cppc-notifications]
==== Notifications
This service group does not support any events for notification.

==== Service: CPPC_ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (SERVICE_ID: 0x01)
This service allows the application processor to subscribe to `CPPC`
service group notifications. The platform may optionally support notifications
for events that may occur. The platform microcontroller can send these
notification messages to the application processor if they are implemented and
the application processor has subscribed to them. The supported events are
described in <<cppc-notifications>>.

==== Service: CPPC_PROBE_REG (SERVICE_ID: 0x02)
This service is used to probe a CPPC register implementation status for a
application processor. If the CPPC register `reg_id` is implemented then
the length in bits is returned in `REG_LENGTH` field. If the register is not
supported or invalid then the `REG_LENGTH` will be `0`.

==== Service: CPPC_WRITE_REG (SERVICE_ID: 0x04)
This service is used to write a CPPC register.

If the fast-channels are supported the application processor must only write
desired performance level in the fast-channel instead of writing into the
`DesiredPerformanceRegister` through this service. Similarly, in case of the
autonomous mode the application processor must write minimum and maximum limit
levels into the fast-channel instead of calling this service for
`MinimumPerformanceRegister` and `MaximumPerformanceRegister`. Otherwise the
writes to these registers may be ignored.

If the number of words required for all available Hart IDs exceeds the number of

microcontroller will set the `REMAINING` and `RETURNED` fields accordingly and
only return the Hart IDs which can be accommodated. The application processor
may need to call this service again with the appropriate `START_INDEX` until the
`REMAINING` field returns `0`.
