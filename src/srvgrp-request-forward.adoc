===  Service Group - REQUEST_FORWARD (SERVICEGROUP_ID: 0x000D)
The REQUEST_FORWARD service group allows application processors to retrieve and
process RPMI request messages which are forwarded by platform microcontroller from
some other RPMI client. This service group also allows an SBI implementation to
forward RPMI request messages from one system-level partition (or domain) to another
using the SBI MPXY extension cite:[SBI].

The platform microcontroller (or SBI implementation) should maintain a first-in
first-out queue of forwarded RPMI request messages. The first (or oldest) forwarded
RPMI request message in the queue is referred to as the current forwarded RPMI request
message. The RPMI services defined by the REQUEST_FORWARD service group allow application
processors to retrieve and process one forwarded RPMI request message at a time.

The <<table_reqfwd_services>> below lists the services defined by the REQUEST_FORWARD
service group:

| Description

| 0x01
| REQFWD_NEW_MESSAGE
| An array of `N` bytes representing the first `N` bytes of the current forwarded
RPMI request message. The value `N` is specified by the `EVENT_DATALEN` field of
the RPMI notification event as shown in <<table_notification_message_format>>.
| This RPMI notification event represents the arrival of a new forwarded RPMI
request message when there were no other pending forwarded RPMI request message
in the queue.
|===

==== Service: REQFWD_ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (SERVICE_ID: 0x01)
This service allows the application processor to subscribe to `REQUEST_FORWARD`
service group notifications. The platform may optionally support notifications
for events that may occur. The platform microcontroller can send these
notification messages to the application processor if they are implemented and
the application processor has subscribed to them. The supported events are
described in <<reqfwd-notifications>>.

==== Service: REQFWD_RETRIEVE_CURRENT_MESSAGE (SERVICE_ID: 0x02)
This service allows application processors to retrieve the current forwarded RPMI
request message. The current message may be the oldest forwarded RPMI request
message in the platform microcontroller (or SBI implementation) queue.

message at byte offset specified by `START_INDEX`.

==== Service: REQFWD_COMPLETE_CURRENT_MESSAGE (SERVICE_ID: 0x03)
This service allows the application processors to inform the platform microcontroller
(or SBI implementation) that:

* The processing of the current forwarded RPMI request message has completed and
RPMI response message must be sent to the original source of RPMI request message.
* The current forwarded RPMI request message must now point to the next forwarded
RPMI request message if available.

If the service is called without retrieving the message, an error is returned.
The service also returns `NUM_MESSAGES`, which is the number of forwarded messages
available for retrieval from the platform microcontroller, excluding the current
forwarded message.
