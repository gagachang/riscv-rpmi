=== Service Group - HART_STATE_MANAGEMENT (SERVICEGROUP_ID: 0x0005)
This service group defines services to control and manage the application
processor (hart) power states. Hart power states include power on, power off,
suspend modes, etc. A hart is identified by a 32-bit identifier called `HART_ID`.

In a platform, depending on the sharing of power controls and common
resources, the harts can be grouped in a hierarchical topology to form cores,
clusters, nodes, etc. In such cases the power state change for a hart can affect
the entire hierarchical group in which the hart is located, requiring coordination
for the power state change. RPMI supports the coordination mechanisms and hart
power states defined by the RISC-V SBI Specification cite:[SBI].

The following table lists the services in the HART_STATE_MANAGEMENT service group:

[#section-hart-states]
==== Hart States
Hart HSM states and the HSM state machine supported by the RPMI
are defined in the RISC-V SBI Specification cite:[SBI]. Refer to
https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-sbi-doc/blob/master/src/ext-hsm.adoc#table_hsm_states[*HSM States*^].

From a hart perspective a start state means hart has started execution of
instructions and stop state means that hart is not executing the instructions.
The platform can implement the stop state either by powering down the hart or
just putting the hart in a platform supported low-power state.

[#section-hart-suspend-types]
==== Hart Suspend Types
The RPMI supports the hart suspend types encoding as defined in
RISC-V SBI Specification cite:[SBI].
Refer to https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-sbi-doc/blob/master/src/ext-hsm.adoc#table_hsm_hart_suspend_types[*HSM Suspend Types*^]. The values for the
platform supported suspend types are discovered through a service defined in
this service group.

[#hsm-notifications]
==== Notifications
This service group does not support any events for notification.

==== Service: HSM_ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (SERVICE_ID: 0x01)
This service allows the application processor to subscribe to `HART_STATE_MANAGEMENT`
service group notifications. The platform may optionally support notifications
for events that may occur. The platform microcontroller can send these
notification messages to the application processor if they are implemented and
the application processor has subscribed to them. The supported events are
described in <<hsm-notifications>>.

If the number of words required for all available Hart IDs exceeds the number of
words that can be returned in one acknowledgement message then the platform
microcontroller will set the `REMAINING` and `RETURNED` fields accordingly and
only return the Hart IDs which can be accommodated. The application processor
may need to call this service again with the appropriate `START_INDEX` until the
`REMAINING` field returns `0`.

==== Service: HSM_GET_SUSPEND_TYPES (SERVICE_ID: 0x04)
This service gets the list of all supported suspend types for a hart.
The suspend types in the list must be ordered based on increasing power savings.

If the number of words required for all available suspend types exceeds the
number of words that can be returned in one acknowledgement message then the
platform microcontroller will set the `REMAINING` and `RETURNED` fields
accordingly and only return the suspend types which can be accommodated.
The application processor may need to call this service again with the
appropriate `START_INDEX` until the `REMAINING` field returns `0`.

The attributes and details of each suspend type can be discovered using the
`HSM_GET_SUSPEND_INFO` service.

==== Service: HSM_GET_SUSPEND_INFO (SERVICE_ID: 0x05)
This service is used to get the attributes of a suspend type. The attributes of
a suspend type include various associated latencies. The entry latency for a
suspend type is the maximum amount of time that the hart requires to transition
from the execution state to the low-power suspend state when the hart invokes an
quiesced state entry mechanism such as WFI.
The exit latency is the time required by the hart to transition from the suspend
state to execution state after the wakeup event.

For each suspend state there is a point of no return after which the suspend
state transition cannot be reversed. The wakeup latency is the maximum time
required by the hart to transition from the point of no return to the execution
state. If the platform returns `0` in `WAKEUP_LATENCY` then the application
processor can use the `(ENTRY_LATENCY + EXIT_LATENCY)` as the wakeup latency.

The minimum residency of a suspend state is the minimum time the application
processor must remain in that suspend state to become energy efficient compared
to the shallower suspend state.

NOTE: The energy is also consumed while entering and exiting a suspend state. The
application processor must spend time equal to or more than minimum residency to
justify the energy cost of entering and exiting that suspend state.

NOTE: The application processor entering into a deeper suspend state with a high
minimum residency will incur a longer wakeup latency due to more time required
to exit that suspend state. If the predicted idle time by the application processor
is less than the minimum residency of a suspend state, it should select the
shallower suspend state to minimize the wakeup latency to achieve energy savings.

==== Service: HSM_HART_START (SERVICE_ID: 0x06)
This service is used to start the execution on a hart identified by `HART_ID`.
This service requires a start address which is the physical address from which
the target hart will start execution. Successful completion of this service means
that the hart has started execution from the specified start address.

==== Service: HSM_HART_STOP (SERVICE_ID: 0x07)
This service stops the execution on the calling hart. The mechanism for stopping
the hart is platform specific. The hart can be powered down, if supported, or put
into the deepest available sleep state.

This service returns successful if the platform microcontroller has successfully
acknowledged that the target hart can be stopped. The hart upon successful
acknowledgement can perform the final context saving if required and must enter
into a quiesced state such as WFI which can be detected and allow the platform
microcontroller to proceed to stop the hart. The mechanism to detect
the hart quiesced state by the platform microcontroller is platform specific.

Once the hart is stopped, it can only be restarted by explicitly invoking the
`HSM_HART_START` service call explicitly by any other hart.

==== Service: HSM_HART_SUSPEND (SERVICE_ID: 0x08)
This service is used to put a hart in a low-power suspend state supported by the
platform. Each suspend type is a 32-bit value which is discovered through the
`HSM_GET_SUSPEND_TYPES` service.

This service returns successful if the platform microcontroller has successfully
acknowledged that the target hart can be put into the requested `SUSPEND_TYPE`
state. The target hart after the successful acknowledgement must enter into a
quiesced state such as WFI which can be detected and allow the platform
microcontroller complete the suspend state transition. The mechanism to detect
the hart quiesced state by the platform microcontroller is platform specific.

For non-retentive suspend state the hart will resume its execution from the
provided resume address.
