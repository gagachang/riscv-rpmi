===  Service Group - DEVICE_POWER (SERVICEGROUP_ID: 0x0009)
This DEVICE_POWER service group provides messages to manage the power states of
a device power domain. This service group is used only for device power
management since system and CPU power management is handled by already defined
service groups such as SYSTEM_RESET, SYSTEM_SUSPEND and HART_STATE_MANAGEMENT.

A domain can consist of one device if its power states can be controlled
independently or it may also have multiple devices if they all share the same
power control lines and power states can only be changed collectively.
Each domain must support ON and OFF states along with custom power states which
are discoverable.  Domains may also have power states which may preserve the
context. The level of context preserved will depends on the level of power state.

Power states for domains will be discovered via supported hardware description
mechanisms where the values for ON and OFF are already fixed and known.
The power state encodes both the power state value and the context preserved or
lost information corresponding to that state.

The DEVICE_POWER services take a 32-bit integer identifier known as `DOMAIN_ID`
to specify the device power domain. These `DOMAIN_ID` identifiers are sequential
and start from `0`.

The following table lists the services in the DEVICE_POWER service group:

[#device-power-notifications]
==== Notifications
This service group does not support any events for notification.

==== Service: DPWR_ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (SERVICE_ID: 0x01)
This service allows the application processor to subscribe to `DEVICE_POWER`
service group notifications. The platform may optionally support notifications
for events that may occur. The platform microcontroller can send these
notification messages to the application processor if they are implemented and
the application processor has subscribed to them. The supported events are
described in <<device-power-notifications>>.
