===  Service Group - SYSTEM_SUSPEND (SERVICEGROUP_ID: 0x0004)
This service group defines services used to request platform microcontroller
to transition the system into a suspend state, also called a sleep state.
The suspend state `SUSPEND_TO_RAM` is supported by default by the platform and
if the application processor requests for `SUSPEND_TO_RAM`, it's implicit for the
platform microcontroller that all the application processors except the one
requesting are in `STOPPED` state and necessary state saving in the RAM has
been complete.

The following table lists the services in the SYSTEM_SUSPEND service group:

[#section-suspend-types]
==== Suspend Types
RPMI supports suspend types and their values as defined by SBI
specification.
Refer to https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-sbi-doc/blob/master/src/ext-sys-suspend.adoc#table_susp_sleep_types[*SBI System Sleep Types*^]
in the RISC-V SBI Specification cite:[SBI] for the `SUSPEND_TYPE` definition.

[#system-suspend-notifications]
==== Notifications
This service group does not support any events for notification.

==== Service: SYSSUSP_ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (SERVICE_ID: 0x01)
This service allows the application processor to subscribe to `SYSTEM_SUSPEND`
service group notifications. The platform may optionally support notifications
for events that may occur. The platform microcontroller can send these
notification messages to the application processor if they are implemented and
the application processor has subscribed to them. The supported events are
described in <<system-suspend-notifications>>.

==== Service: SYSSUSP_GET_ATTRIBUTES (SERVICE_ID: 0x02)
This service is used to discover the attributes of a suspend type. The
attribute flags for a suspend type indicate whether a `SUSPEND_TYPE` is
supported. Additionally, the flags specify whether a `SUSPEND_TYPE` supports
a resume address.

==== Service: SYSSUSP_SUSPEND (SERVICE_ID: 0x03)
This service is used to request the platform microcontroller to transition the
system in a suspend state. This service returns successfully when the platform
microcontroller accepts the system suspend request. The application processor
which called this service must then enter into a quiesced state such as WFI. The
platform microcontroller will transition the system to the requested
`SUSPEND_TYPE` upon the successful transition of the application processor into
the supported quiesced state. The mechanism for detecting the quiesced state of
the application processor is platform specific.

The application processor must only request supported suspend types, discovered
using the `SYSSUSP_GET_ATTRIBUTES` service.

If a suspend type does not support the custom resume address that the
application processor can discover through the `SYSSUSP_GET_ATTRIBUTES` service
then the `RESUME_ADDR_LOW` and `RESUME_ADDR_HIGH` will be ignored and the
application processor will resume from the `pc` (program counter) after the
instruction that put the application processor in the quiesced state,
such as the `WFI` instruction.
