===  Service Group - PERFORMANCE (SERVICEGROUP_ID: 0x000A)
This PERFORMANCE service group is used to manage the performance of a
group of devices or application processors that operate in the same performance
domain. Unlike traditional performance control mechanisms, where the OS is
responsible for directly controlling voltages and clocks, this mechanism instead
operates on an metric less integer performance scale. Each integer value on this
scale represents a performance operating point. What this scale represents and
the metric is entirely platform-dependent. Values on this scale are represented
with `performance level index`, and the platform has complete control over
mapping these performance operating points to performance states, which are
eventually converted into hardware parameters such as voltage and frequency. The
level index does not need to be contiguous or to be on a linear scale. For
example, the mapping between levels index and frequencies can be as
straightforward as using a multiplication factor of `1000` or ascending index
number starting from `0`.

The CPPC service group is designed for performance control, but it is only
intended for application processors. This service group is primarily meant for
devices such as GPUs and accelerators, though it can also be used for
application processors.

It is important to distinguish between performance domains and power domains.
A performance domain refers to a set of devices that must always operate at the
same performance level, whereas a power domain refers to a set of devices that
can be turned on or off together for power management purposes.

The following table lists the services in the PERFORMANCE service group:

==== Performance Fast-channel
This section provides an overview of the properties associated with the fast-channel
for PERFORMANCE service group.

*Supported Services*::
The fast-channel currently supports only the following PERFORMANCE services:
* PERF_GET_LEVEL
* PERF_SET_LEVEL
* PERF_GET_LIMIT
* PERF_SET_LIMIT


*Platform Dependency*::
* Not all performance domains or performance services are required to support
  fast-channel functionality.
* Support for fast-channel depends on the platform implementation.


*Performance Fast-channel Shared Memory Region*::
* In the memory region designated by the platform for fast-channels, it is
  essential that the Performance fast-channels are organized in a continuous
  memory block.
* The shared memory region designated for fast-channels across performance
  service group must be a `power-of-two` in size. The base address and size (in
  bytes) of this shared memory region can be obtained through the service
  `PERF_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_REGION`. The base address of the shared memory region
  must be aligned to 8 bytes.


*Discovering Fast-channel*::
* Fast-channels support are discoverable through PERFORMANCE service calls.
* To determine if a platform supports fast-channel for a specific performance
  domain, use the `PERF_GET_ATTRIBUTES` service call.
* If fast-channel support is available, retrieve fast-channel attributes for
  specific PERFORMANCE service call using the `PERF_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_ATTRIBUTES`
  service call.
* The `PERF_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_REGION` provides physical memory for Performance
  Service Group. The offset of the physical address retrieve in
  `PERF_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_ATTRIBUTES` of the 'Performance Domain /
  Service ID' paired is based on the starting address in
  `PERF_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_REGION` service.


*Doorbell Support*::
* The doorbell details such as doorbell register address and preserve mask can
  be discovered by the application processor through the
  `PERF_GET_FAST_CHANNEL_ATTRIBUTES` service.
* The doorbell register address is the physical address of the register which
  needs to be written to trigger the doorbell interrupt. The doorbell set mask
  is the mask of bits which must be set when writing in the doorbell register.
  The doorbell preserve mask is the mask of bits which must be preserved when
  writing in the doorbell register. The width of the doorbell set mask and
  doorbell preserve mask must be equal to the doorbell register width.
* Doorbell support is not available for `PERF_GET_LEVEL` and `PERF_GET_LIMIT`
  service calls.
* When fast-channels are implemented for `PERF_GET_LEVEL` and `PERF_GET_LIMIT`
  service calls, the last known valid performance level or performance limits
  are always accessible via the fast-channel without requiring a doorbell
  trigger.
* For other PERFORMANCE service calls that support fast-channel, doorbell
  support is optional.


*Payload Requirements*::
* The payload of a fast-channel should exclusively include message specific
  parameters and exclude the `DOMAIN_ID`. Since a fast-channel is specific to
  both `DOMAIN_ID` and `SERVICE_ID`, there is no need to include `DOMAIN_ID`
  or any other channel specific and message specific headers when using a
  fast-channel. For instance, the payload of the `PERF_SET_LIMIT` message
  should consist of a 32-bit `MAX_PERF_LEVEL` and a 32-bit `MIN_PERF_LEVEL`.

[#performance-notifications]
==== Notifications
When a client registers for performance change notifications, the platform will
send notification to the client whenever there is a change in the performance
level, performance limit or the performance power of a specific performance
domain. This notification is typically sent by the platform microcontroller to
inform clients in the system about changes in the performance domain.

==== Service: PERF_ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (SERVICE_ID: 0x01)
This service allows the application processor to subscribe to `PERFORMANCE`
service group notifications. The platform may optionally support notifications
for events that may occur. The platform microcontroller can send these
notification messages to the application processor if they are implemented and
the application processor has subscribed to them. The supported events are
described in <<performance-notifications>>.

==== Service: PERF_GET_NUM_DOMAINS (SERVICE_ID: 0x02)
This service returns the number of performance domains supported by the system.
The number of performance domains may vary depending on the hardware platform
and its implementation. In general, performance domains are used to group related
hardware components, such as CPUs, GPUs, memory, and peripherals, into separate
domains that can be independently controlled and managed. This allows for more
fine-grained control over the performance of specific components, which can be
important for optimizing system performance and power consumption.

==== Service: PERF_GET_SUPPORTED_LEVELS (SERVICE_ID: 0x04)
This service provides a list of the available performance levels or also called
operating performance points (OPPs) for a specific performance domain. These
represent different performance levels that can be set for the components in the
domain, and are defined by a combination of frequency, power cost and other
parameters. By using this information, the OS can select the optimal
performance level based on the system's workload and power constraints using
`performance level index` returned in this service.

```c
/* Pseudocode to retrieve the list of the supported performance levels. */

index = 0;
num = 0;
/* Allocate a buffer based on the value returned from the flags[7:0] */
total_num_levels = perf_domain_attributes.flags[7:0];

loop:
	list = get_domain_opp_list(index, domain_id);
	entry_num = 0;

	for (i = 0; i < list.returned; i++, num++) {
		opp[num].index = list.entry[entry_num++];
		opp[num].freq = list.entry[entry_num++];
		opp[num].power = list.entry[entry_num++];
		opp[num].transition_latency = list.entry[entry_num++];
	}

	/* Check if there are remaining OPP to be read */
	if (list.remaining) {
		index += list.returned;
		goto loop;
	}


```
The pseudocode above demonstrates the process for retrieving the level
information for a specific performance domain. First, the number of
performance levels is determined by checking the `FLAGS[7:0]` parameter
returned by the `PERF_GET_ATTRIBUTES` service.

The total number of performance levels included in one message must not exceed
the available word count in the message's `DATA` field. If the performance levels
exceed this limit, the platform microcontroller will return the number of
levels that can be accommodated in one message and set the `REMAINING` field
accordingly. When the `REMAINING` field is not zero, the application processor
must call this service again with the appropriate `PERF_LEVEL_INDEX` to retrieve
the remaining levels. Multiple service calls may be required to obtain all the
levels.

==== Service: PERF_SET_LIMIT (SERVICE_ID: 0x08)
This service is used to set the performance limit of a specific
performance domain in the system. The platform must ensure that any subsequent
calls to `PERF_SET_LEVEL` to adjust the performance level remain within the
currently defined limits.

If the current performance level falls outside the newly defined minimum or
maximum ranges, the platform will automatically adjust it to comply with the
updated limits.

[NOTE]
====
Examples:

* If the current performance level is below the new minimum limit, the platform
  will set it to the new minimum limit.

* If the current performance level exceeds the new maximum limit, the platform
  will set it to the new maximum limit.

* No adjustment is required if the current performance level is within the new
  limits.
====

If notifications are enabled, the platform will send an appropriate
notification (e.g., `PERF_LEVEL_CHANGE`, `PERF_POWER_CHANGE`, etc.) to the
application processor.
